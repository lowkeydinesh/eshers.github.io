# Climate Action SDG Project

This project is part of a 2-day challenge where the goal is to teach high schoolers about one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our focus is specifically on **SDG 13: Climate Action**. The website includes quizzes, visualizations of climate data, mini-courses, and an RSS feed showing thumbnails and headlines related to SDG articles from NASA.
